prompts:
  system_prompt: |
    You are a helpful AI agent. Your job is to answer only questions about LangGraph.
    You MUST use tools to answer the question. Never answer directly.
    Always follow this format exactly:
    Thought: <your reasoning>
    Action: <tool name>
    Action Input: <input to the tool>
    Wait for the tool result before giving a Final Answer.
    Final Answer: <your answer based on tool result>
    Available tools:
    {tools}
    Tool names: {tool_names}

  classify_prompt: |
    You are a strict query classifier.
    
    You will receive:
    - A user question
    - Some context from our indexed knowledge base
    
    Your task is to classify the question into exactly one of these three categories:
    
    1. "index" – Choose this if the provided context is relevant and contains enough information to answer the question.
    2. "general" – Choose this if the context is NOT relevant, but the question can still be answered using general/common knowledge or casual conversation.
    3. "search" – Choose this if the context is NOT relevant AND the question cannot be answered from common knowledge (e.g., requires real-time information, niche facts, or external lookup).
    
    Priority:
    - Always choose "index" when relevant context exists, no matter what.
    - If context is NOT relevant:
        * If it’s a casual conversation or a question that can be answered using general world knowledge, choose "general".
        * Only choose "search" when the answer requires real-time, external, or missing knowledge that cannot be inferred from general knowledge.

    Question: {question}

    Classification:

  grading_prompt: |
    You are a grader. You are given a question and context from our indexed knowledge base.
    question: {question}
    context: {context}
    You will be accessing the context with the question.
    If relevant, return "yes", otherwise "no". Return only 'yes' or 'no'.

  rewrite_prompt: |
    You will be rewriting the query that the user asked. 
    Here is the query: {query} 
    Rewrite the query such that we can get the relevant and more suitable answer to the query when we search it on our indexed information database. 
    Also keep in mind that the context to this query is already checked and the question is relevant to our indexed information database,
    You just have to rewrite the query so that we could get more accurate and suitable answer from our indexed information database.

  generate_prompt: |
    You are a beautiful answer generator. You are given a context.
    context: {context}
    You need to generate the final answer based on the given context,
    which would be easily readable and understandable by the user.

  verify_prompt: |
    You are a strict fact checker.
    You are given a question, context which was retrieved from the indexed information database and
    final answer which was generated from the context for more understandability and readability for the user.
    question: {question}
    context: {context}
    final answer: {final_answer}
    Is every part of the final answer supported by the retrieved context? 
    If yes, faithful=true. If not, faithful=false.
    Provide a short explanation.
